MapInfoProfileTool
==================

plots elevation profiles from native mapinfo grids, simply draw a line on the mapper window and a graph + table of data will show the elevations.

WARNING - MapInfo 12.5 + (inc x64) is (might be) getting a new grid extention, this will likley change the way the native grid handler works and there's a good change it will render this tool useless.
